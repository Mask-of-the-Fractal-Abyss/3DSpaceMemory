# 3DSpaceMemory

This game is intended to be an intellectual exploration of the limits of memory.  Players will explore a randomly generated 3 dimensional universe, without any graphical interface.  Players will be informed of their surrounding via text-to-speech dialogue, and they will have to remember the scenery they have passed, so that they can work around it, since forgetting can be fatal.
